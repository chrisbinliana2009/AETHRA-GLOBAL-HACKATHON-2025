# AETHRA-GLOBAL-HACKATHON-2025
RedFlame Sentinel is a fireless, eco-safe safety torch designed to protect forest-fringe communities from wildlife intrusions. Using LED–laser flame visuals, blower-driven motion, and wildlife-safe sound, it provides instant, portable, and non-harmful protection for villagers, farmers, and night-time users.

## 🌍 Project Overview
**RedFlame Sentinel – Eco-Safe Guardian** is a **fireless wildlife-deterrent safety device** designed to protect forest-fringe communities from dangerous night-time animal intrusions.  
Instead of using real fire, crackers, or electric fencing—which cause forest fires, injuries, and pollution—this device uses:

- 🔴 **LED + Laser flame visuals**  
- 🌬️ **Blower-driven flame movement (silk cloth)**  
- 🔊 **Wildlife-safe deterrent sound**  
- 🔋 **Rechargeable 12V system**

It is portable, eco-friendly, and safe for both **people and wildlife**.

## ⭐ Inspiration
Human–wildlife conflict affects millions of people living near forests.  
Farmers and villagers rely on unsafe methods such as burning tires, lighting fires, or bursting crackers, which lead to:

- Forest fires  
- Human injuries  
- Wildlife stress  
- Crop loss and property damage  

We asked:  
### **“Can we recreate the protective effect of fire, without using fire?”**

This question inspired the creation of **RedFlame Sentinel**, a safe and sustainable flame-effect device.

---

## ⚡ What It Does
RedFlame Sentinel protects people by producing:

- **A bright and realistic flame visual** (LEDs + laser + reflector)  
- **Continuous flame motion** (blower lifting silk cloth)  
- **Alerting deterrent sound signals** (USB sound module + speaker)  

These three signals naturally repel wild animals—**without harming them**.

It is ideal for:  
✔ Villagers near forests  
✔ Farmers  
✔ Forest watchers  
✔ Students walking in rural areas  
✔ Night-shift workers  
✔ Tribal communities

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Using a combination of optical, mechanical, and electronic elements, we built a portable fireless flame system.

### **Internal Components**
- **Laser Module** – produces sharp flame highlights  
- **LED Array** – creates core flame glow  
- **Reflective Chamber** – amplifies light  
- **Blower Fan** – lifts silk cloth to simulate flame  
- **USB Sound Device** – plays deterrent audio  
- **Speaker** – outputs wildlife-safe sound  
- **12V Rechargeable Battery** – main power  
- **Voltage Regulator** – stable output  
- **AC Adapter** – for charging  

### **Core Principle**
🔥 **Light + Motion + Sound** = **Safe Wildlife Deterrence**

## 🧩 Challenges We Ran Into
- Creating realistic flame visuals without heat  
- Getting the blower strength perfect for silk movement  
- Balancing LED + laser brightness for visibility without glare  
- Keeping the device small, light, and affordable  
- Ensuring wildlife safety with non-harmful sound patterns  

---
